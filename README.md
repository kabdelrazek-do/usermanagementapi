# User Management API

A comprehensive ASP.NET Core Web API for managing user records, built for TechHive Solutions' internal tools. This project demonstrates enterprise-level API development with comprehensive middleware, security, and monitoring capabilities.

## ðŸš€ **Project Status: Production Ready**

This API has been developed across three comprehensive activities and is now ready for production deployment with enterprise-level features including authentication, comprehensive logging, error handling, and security compliance.

## Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete user records
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using Data Annotations
- **Soft Delete**: Users are marked as inactive rather than permanently deleted
- **Search Functionality**: Find users by department or email
- **RESTful Design**: Follows REST API best practices
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

- Pagination for large datasets
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Logging and monitoring
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker containerization
